# Arbitrage (Contango) Futures Contract Profit Model
Excel financial model aimed at quantitatively determining arbitrage ("riskless") profit values given a contango (futures prices are higher than spot prices) situation. 
Two strategies are explored depending on the value of the theoretical futures price relative to the futures contract price. Take a look and feel free to epxlore interactively with 
your own values.
